You would probably get a more comprehensive list by investigating on your own.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the above list is not a complete one; but this would be a great time to point something out to you - writing your back-end in Python would not <em>automatically</em> make your site as fast and scalable as YouTube. We cite the list of sites above to simply point out that Python is a favorite of many software engineers in the industry, for web-development.</p>\n<p>Python gives you the lego blocks to build robust, scalable web applications. You also get to enjoy the ease of writing Python modules while building it. But a weapon is only as potent as its master. If you don\'t know how to wield it, you would end up probably shooting yourself in the foot.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Web Applications Using Python",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/web-applications-using-python/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/web-applications-using-python/"}}}});
