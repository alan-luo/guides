That means, an Interface cannot contain the implementation of any method, just its signature, i.e. the name, parameters and exceptions of the method. For example :</p>\\n<pre><code>public interface Vehicle {\\n    public String licensePlate = \\\"\\\";\\n    public void start();\\n    public void stop();\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The interface above contains one field and two methods. Alone, it is not of much use, but they are usually used along with Classes. How? Simple, you have to make sure some class <code>implements</code> it.</p>\\n<pre><code>public class Car implements Vehicle {\\n    public void start() {\\n        System.out.println(\\\"starting engine...\\\");\\n    }\\n    public void stop() {\\n        System.out.println(\\\"stopping engine...\\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><img src=\\\"//forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/rocket.png?v=2\\\" alt=\\\":rocket:\\\" title=\\\":rocket:\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://repl.it/CItd/0\\\">Run Code</a></p>\\n<p>Now, there is a <strong>ground rule</strong> : The Class must implement <strong>all</strong> of the methods in the Interface.

The class <em>does not</em> need to declare the fields though, only the methods.</p>\\n<h2>Instances of an Interface</h2>\\n<p>Once you create a Java Class which <code>implements</code> any Interface, the object instance can be referenced as an instance of the Interface.

This lead to lot of confusion and code breaks if an Interface definition is suddenly changed.</p>\\n<p>Suppose, you wrote an open source library, which contains an Interface. Say, your clients, i.e. practically all developers around the world, are using it heavily and are happy. Now you have had to upgrade the library by adding a new method definition to the Interface to support a new feature. But that would break <em>all</em> builds since all Classes implementing that Interface has to change now. What a catastrophe!</p>\\n<p>Thankfully, Java 8 now provides us <code>default</code> methods of Interfaces. A <code>default</code> method <em>can</em> contain its own implementation <em>directly</em> within the Interface! So, if a Class does not implement a default method, the compiler will take the implementation mentioned within the Interface. Nice, isn't it? So in your library, you may add any number of default methods in interfaces without the fear of breaking anything!</p>\\n<pre><code>public interface GPS {\\n    public void getCoordinates();\\n    default public void getRoughCoordinates() {\\n        // implementation to return coordinates from rough sources\\n        // such as wifi &#x26; mobile\\n        System.out.println(\\\"Fetching rough coordinates...\\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npublic interface Radio {\\n    public void startRadio();\\n    public void stopRadio();\\n}\\n\\npublic class Smartphone implements GPS,Radio {\\n    public void getCoordinates() {\\n        // return some coordinates\\n    }\\n    public void startRadio() {\\n      // start Radio\\n    }\\n    public void stopRadio() {\\n        // stop Radio\\n    }\\n\\n    // no implementation of getRoughCoordinates()\\n}\\n\\nSmartphone motoG = new Smartphone();\\nmotog.getRoughCoordinates(); // Fetching rough coordinates...\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><img src=\\\"//forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/rocket.png?v=2\\\" alt=\\\":rocket:\\\" title=\\\":rocket:\\\"> <a href=\\\"https://repl.it/CItp/0\\\">Run Code</a></p>\\n<h3>But, what happens if two interfaces have the same method signature?</h3>\\n<p>Awesome question. In that case, if you do not provide the implementation in the Class, poor compiler will get confused and simply fail! You have to provide a default method implemention within the Class also.
