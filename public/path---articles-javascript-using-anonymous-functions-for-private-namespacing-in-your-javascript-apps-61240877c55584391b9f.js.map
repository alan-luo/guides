When you first begin writing JS apps, you generally just type the code out and run it.

By simply typing that line into a script, we've created a variable named <em>points</em> that can track the points gained by the user.</p>\\n<p>And that's all fine and well, but let's say that we have a more advanced user playing the game. This user knows how to look at the source of a web page, and so this person takes a peek at the source behind the JS game and realizes that the <em>points</em> variable is just sitting there in the <strong>global namespace</strong>. An evil smirk descends across their face as they contemplate the points they can achieve! They decide that they don't want to wait to beat some baddies up, or smash some mushrooms, or what have you, to rack up a bunch of points. They want their points now! Well, how does <em>a quadrillion billion million</em> points sound?! So, they load up the console on their favorite browser, and simply type into the console:</p>\\n<pre><code>points = 34750925489459203859095480917458059034;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Once the user hits enter, the <em>points</em> variable is updated in the game. Now, the user has a truly humongous, and likely unrealistic, amount of points in the game, and he can brag to his friends that no one can possibly beat his awesome score.</p>\\n<p>So, how do we prevent this from occurring? This is where <strong>private namespaces</strong> come into play.</p>\\n<h2>Private Namespaces</h2>\\n<p><strong>Private namespaces</strong> allow developers to put their code into sections (or <strong>namespaces</strong>). These sections operate independently of each other but can still read and write from the <strong>global namespace</strong>.</p>\\n<p>To break this down into simpler terms from a real life scenario, let's say you are working in an office building. You have your own office, and you see others with their own offices. Each office is locked, and only the person who owns the office has a key to this office. Let's also say that you have some type of new super lock that makes your office impenetrable by any other person in the building. Let's consider the office building itself as the <strong>global namespace</strong> and each office as a <strong>private namespace</strong>. You don't have access to anyone else's office nor do they have access to yours. But, each one of you have access to the rest of the office building, whether that's getting coffee, grabbing a snack, etc. Each one of you can grab something from the <strong>global namespace</strong> (or create/modify something there), but you can't create/modify/grab anything from each other's offices; you can only create/modify/grab from your own <strong>private namespace</strong>/office.</p>\\n<h2>Achieving a Private Namespace</h2>\\n<p>So, how do we achieve this <strong>private namespace</strong> in JavaScript?
