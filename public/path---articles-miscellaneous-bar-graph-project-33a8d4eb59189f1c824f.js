D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS.</p>\n<p>D3.js helps you attach your data to DOM (Document Object Model) elements. Then you can use CSS3, HTML, and/or SVG showcase this data. Finally, you can make the data interactive through the use of D3.js data-driven transformations and transitions.</p>\n<h2>Project Explanation:</h2>\n<h3>Scenario:</h3>\n<p>There"s a class of Online students interacting with different topics of the subject and gives quiz on those topics.</p>\n<p>There are 15 topics and on each topic, we have a numbers of student who have taken quiz and have scored in three categories: Low, Mid and High</p>\n<h3>For example (Given data ):</h3>\n<p>Topic: "1", low: 4, mid:13, high: 18  </p>\n<p>Topic: "2", low: 11, mid:12, high: 6  </p>\n<p>Topic: "3", low: 12, mid:24, high: 6 and so on.</p>\n<p>Note that Topic 1 has<code>4 + 13 + 8 = 35</code> student has taken the quiz and Topic 2 has <code>11+12+6 = 29</code> student and topic 3 has 42 students and so on.</p>\n<p>We want to make interactive Bar and Pie charts. For example, a mouse hover on one of the bars will change the pie chart accordingly and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>With Interactive combination of bar chart and pie chart, where bar chart shows number of students who have interacted with particular topic(taken the quiz) and pie chart showing classification of that students performance in categories of "low, mid, high", we can visualize our data and get more data analysis from it.</p>\n<h2>Hints and Resources:</h2>\n<h3>Step by Step instructions:</h3>\n<p><a href="https://d3js.org"><strong>D3 Introduction:</strong></a> where you can learn about Selections , Dynamic properties and Transitions in D3.js.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the main javascript function, write a function to handle Histogram (Bar chart) - Histogram will show the total number of students who has taken the quiz (interacted with that topic) for 15 topics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Here"s the <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/"><strong>Tutorial</strong></a> where you can learn how to make a bar chart using the D3 JavaScript library.
