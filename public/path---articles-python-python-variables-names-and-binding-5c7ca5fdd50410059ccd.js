In order to use an <em>object</em>, there must be a way to reference them. In Python this is done by <strong>binding</strong> objects to <strong>names</strong>. A detailed overview of can be found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html">here</a></p>\n<p>One way this is done is by using an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements"><em>assignment statement</em></a>. This is commonly called <em>assigning a variable</em> in the context of Python. If speaking about programming in the context of other languages, <strong>binding</strong> an <em>object</em> to a <strong>name</strong> may be more precise.</p>\n<pre><code>>>> some_number = 1\n>>> print(some_number)\n1\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the example above, the target of the assignment statement is a name (identifier), <code>some_number</code>. The <em>object</em> being assigned is the number 1. The statement <strong>binds</strong> the <em>object</em> to the <strong>name</strong>. The second statement, we use this binding <code>print</code> the <em>object</em> that <code>some_number</code> refers to.</p>\n<p>The identifier is not preceeded by a <em>type</em>. That is because Python is dynamically-typed language. The identifier is bound to an <em>object</em> that does have a <em>type</em>, however, the identifier itself can be rebound to another <em>object</em> of a different <em>type</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>>>> some_variable = 1\n>>> print(some_variable)\n1\n>>> some_variable = "Hello campers!"\n>>> print(some_variable)\nHello campers!\n</code></pre>',frontmatter:{title:"Python Variables Names and Binding",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/python/python-variables-names-and-binding/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/python/python-variables-names-and-binding/"}}}});
