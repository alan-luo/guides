Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries. The references are part of a container\'s value. In most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the values, not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are implied. So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is changed.</p>\n<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types">Python Docs - Object Values &#x26; Types</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Python Containers",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/python/python-containers/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/python/python-containers/"}}}});
