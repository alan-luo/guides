Installing Webpack allows us to run <code>webpack</code> from the terminal to execute a Webpack script. Installing Webpack Dev Server allows us to run a localhost server using our Webpack configuration. This will all become clear a little later.</p>\n<p>In your directory of choice, make a new directory, for example <code>react-webpack-example</code>, and change directory into it:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir react-webpack-example &#x26;&#x26; cd $_\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we\'re in our new directory, we need to create our Webpack file, which will live in the root. This is a configuration file, and so we name it <code>webpack.config.js</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>touch webpack.config.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, we can go ahead and <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init">initialise an npm project</a> using the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>npm init\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can go ahead and press the enter key to cycle through the options presented to us in the terminal.</p>\n<p>The <code>npm init</code> command will create a <code>package.json</code> file, which is going to contain important data about our project.</p>\n<p>So far, this is what our tree should look like:  </p>\n<pre><code>.\n├── package.json\n└── webpack.config.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you open your <code>package.json</code> file, you should see something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  "name": "react-webpack-example",\n  "version": "1.0.0",\n  "description": "",\n  "main": "webpack.config.js",\n  "scripts": {\n    "test": "echo \\"Error: no test specified\\" &#x26;&#x26; exit 1"\n  },\n  "author": "",\n  "license": "ISC"\n}\n</code></pre>',frontmatter:{title:"Initializing the React Project with Webpack",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/initializing-the-react-project-with-webpack/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/initializing-the-react-project-with-webpack/"}}}});
