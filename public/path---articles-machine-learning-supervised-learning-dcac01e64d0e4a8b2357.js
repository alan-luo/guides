In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.</p>\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n<p>Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.</p>\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n<p>(a) Regression - For continuous-response values. For example given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture</p>\n<p>(b) Classification - for categorical response values, where the data can be separated into specific “classes”. For example given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Supervised Learning",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/machine-learning/supervised-learning/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/machine-learning/supervised-learning/"}}}});
