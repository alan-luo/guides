For many of our campers and stakeholders, this is their first exposure to Agile. While you\'re not expected to be an Agile expert, here are a few terms it would be helpful to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Task Board</strong> - A chart that lists what needs to be done, what\'s being worked on, and what\'s been completed. We use Trello as our task board.</li>\n<li><strong>Sprint</strong> - A period of development. We generally use a one week sprint length.</li>\n<li><strong>Sprint Conference</strong> - A meeting held at the end of each sprint to discuss the progress made and solicit feedback. Also commonly referred to as a sprint review.</li>\n<li><strong>Stakeholder</strong> - Someone outside the development team who has an interest in the project and its development.</li>\n<li><strong>User Story</strong> - A requirement or feature that the product must meet/include.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For additional information on Agile you can check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management">agile management</a> page on Wikipedia or take a look at the <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/agile-project-management-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html">Agile Project Management for Dummies Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>\n<h2>Tools we use</h2>\n<p><a href="http://www.gotomeeting.com">GoToMeeting</a> - We use GoToMeeting to hold our online project management conferences.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.when2meet.com">When2Meet</a> - We use When2Meet to share our availability with the team.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a> - We use Trello to track our volunteer web development projects.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> - We use Google Calendar to track our project conferences.</p>\n<h2>Trello Board Standard Layout</h2>\n<p>When setting up the Trello board for your project, create the following lists (in this order left to right).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>General Information</strong> - This list will include general information that might be useful to the team such as links to current sites, a description of the current or proposed workflow, or any other information that could be useful to the development team.</li>\n<li><strong>Project Scope</strong> - This list provides a general outline of what the project should accomplish.</li>\n<li><strong>User Stories</strong> - These are the <em>specific</em> features that the development must include.</li>\n<li><strong>In Progress</strong> - These are the user stories that the team is currently working on.</li>\n<li><strong>Recently Completed</strong> - These are the user stories that the team has completed since the last project conference.</li>\n<li><strong>Demo\'d</strong> - These are the user stories that have been demo\'d to, and accepted by, the client.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Organizing a Scope Call</h2>\n<p>In Progress.</p>\n<h2>Sprint Call Checklist</h2>\n<h3>1-2 Days Prior to the Conference</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the Google Calendar event and reach out to any individuals that have not responded.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Day of, and during, the Conference</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Send out conference invite and details 10 minutes before the call is scheduled.</li>\n<li>Join the meeting at least 5 minutes early. You should be unmuted and available to engage in conversation with the campers and stakeholder(s).</li>\n<li>Show and Tell time. Ask the campers "So what did you work on this week? Would you like to share your screen and demo?"</li>\n<li>Ask the campers "Did you run into any issues this week?"</li>\n<li>Go through each card in the Recently Completed list and make sure that the user story has been addressed.</li>\n<li>Ask the stakeholder if they have any questions about the Recently Completed user stories.</li>\n<li>After each Recently Completed card has been discussed, drag it over to the Demo\'d list.</li>\n<li>Ask the campers "What are you planning to work on this week?"</li>\n<li>Drag the chosen User Stories card to the In Progress list.</li>\n<li>Schedule the next sprint conference. "Same time next week?" usually works well. Don\'t forget to send out invites using Google Calendar.</li>\n</ol>',frontmatter:{title:"Agile Project Management Terminology",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/agile-project-management-terminology/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/agile-project-management-terminology/"}}}});
