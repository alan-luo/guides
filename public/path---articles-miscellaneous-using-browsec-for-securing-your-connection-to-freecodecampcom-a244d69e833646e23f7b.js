By encrypting our traffic we bypass the ISP\'s ability to modify or cache our content as it passes through their infrastructure.</p>\n<p>This can be done with a useful browser add-on called <a href="https://browsec.com/en/">Browsec</a>.</p>\n<h3>How does the add-on work?</h3>\n<p>The add-on creates a VPN connection between your device and the outside world. That is, Mr. Peeping Tom (ISP), can\'t mess with your connection to the FCC website. Its technically same as if you were not in your home, but accessing the FCC website from US, Netherlands, or other similar places.</p>\n<p><em>Behind the scenes it encrypts the data transmission, and hides your IP.</em></p>\n<h2>I am sold, Show me the steps.</h2>\n<p>There you go!</p>\n<h3>For Google Chrome :</h3>\n<h4>Step 1 : Install the browsec extension.</h4>\n<p>You can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browsec/omghfjlpggmjjaagoclmmobgdodcjboh">download and install the browsec plugin</a> for Chrome from the offical WebStore.</p>\n<p><img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/6/61bd52ed78c56369e62ca376b6dd9e56abcb6363.png" alt="Image for &#x27;Browsec on Google Chrome WebStore&#x27;"></p>\n<h4>Step 2 : Clear your browser cookies and cache (optional).</h4>\n<p>It\'s a good thing if you clear your browser cache for the first time you are going to use browsec, so that your browser loads all the files from scratch.</p>\n<h4>Step 3 : Restart your browser, and visit <a href="http://freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp.com</a></h4>\n<p>Just close your browser, and restart it. Check the browsec extention, for your desired endpoint location.</p>\n<h3>For Mozilla Firefox :</h3>\n<p>Download a portable Firefox version, with bundled add-on, from the <a href="https://browsec.com/en/dashboard/main">Browsec website</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/b/b30fbf3bade330044e18b3c37409f2437a3810c1.png" alt="Image for &#x27;Browsec on Google Chrome WebStore&#x27;"></p>\n<p>That\'s it!

Why not? However remember that this does not make you invisible to law, so be careful of what you are doing! <img src="//forum.freecodecamp.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" alt=":wink:" title=":wink:"></p>\n<h3>What if this doesn\'t work for me?</h3>\n<p>Please let us know in the <a href="https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Help">Help Chat</a>, we will try our best to find a workaround.</p>\n<h4><em>Disclaimer</em></h4>\n<p><strong><em>FreeCodeCamp does NOT endorse any of the softwares mentioned in this article, please use them at your own discretion.
