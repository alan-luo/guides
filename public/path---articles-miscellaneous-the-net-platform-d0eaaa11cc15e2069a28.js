C# is the most popular language used to develop a range of .NET applications, such as <a href="http://www.asp.net/">web apps</a>, <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/">windows aps</a>, <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/platform">Mac and iPhone apps</a>.</p>\n<p>We will start with learning <a>C# programing language</a>, and will make you familiar with development environment, project structures, techniques, and best practices that you will perform as a professional developer.</p>\n<p>First let\'s begin with a brief overview of the .NET platform, and get some jargons out of the way. Don\'t worry, you don\'t have to know in-depth about these at this point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/w0x726c2(v=vs.110).aspx">.NET Framework</a> : (<em>pronounced dot net</em>) provides configuration for your application to run on top of it. It provides all the services an app needs; for instance communication with database, networks, file systems which are commonly used to build console, desktop, web, mobile and game applications.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bs2ecf4(v=vs.100).aspx">CLR (Common Language Runtime)</a> : is an execution environment for your application which manages its life-cycle. CLR provides services like memory management, and is:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>1. implementation of <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm">CLI standard(Common Language Infrastructure)</a>\n2. designed to be platform-independent. Platform refers to the computer architecture and operating system.\n3. language independent, for instance can be used for C#, C++,<a href="">VB.NET</a> and <a href="">F#</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>C-Sharp Compiler : a <code>csc.exe</code> is a compiler which transforms C# code into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), commonly referred as IL. It defines instructions which CLR can understand. CLR\'s job is to read these instructions and tranform them into machine-understandable instructions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class libraries : It contains thousands of in-built classes for your application\'s use, for example <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>System.IO</code></a> for reading/writing data streams, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.http.httpclient(v=vs.118).aspx"><code>HttpClient</code></a> sends data over network, <a href="http://www.asp.net/"><code>ASP.NET</code></a> for web applications, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h43ks021(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>ADO.NET</code></a>for data access to relational databases (like Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL), and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms735119(v=vs.90).aspx">Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)</a> for service-oriented applications which communicates over established protocols like HTTP, REST, SOAP and TCP etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The C# Programming Language (<em>pronounced "C-sharp"</em>) : C# has a syntax similar to Java, C++, and Javascript. It is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>used to write applications, services and reusable libraries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>designed to work with .NET platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>strongly typed, high level object oriented language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/12/04/introducing-net-core/">.NET Core</a> : is Microsoft\'s recent endeavour to move towards open source, cross platform development delivered as <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">Nuget</a> packages. They are working with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> community, which is an implementation of Microsoft .NET framework to build apps on Windows, Linux, and iOS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/">Silverlight</a> : primarily intended to focus on web browsers plug-in to provide enrich multimedia.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/">.NET for windows app</a> : used to create Windows 8.x Store apps using C#.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The C# programing language</h2>\n<p>Next step to learn the <a>C# programing language</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"The Net Platform",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/the-net-platform/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/the-net-platform/"}}}});
