Since Bash is Terminal's default command-line interpreter, you can also set Bash aliases to reduce your keystrokes even further.</p>\n<p>Here's a list of Git Bash aliases and functions. To use them as your own, just add them to the file you store your aliases/functions in.

(i.e. for aliases, there must be no spaces before and after the equal signs, and for functions, there must be a space after the opening curly bracket of the declaration and a semicolon after the command. Don't forget to reload your file (source <code>~/.bash_profile</code>) or restart Terminal after making changes.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Wiki Git Aliases",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/wiki-git-aliases/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/wiki-git-aliases/"}}}});
