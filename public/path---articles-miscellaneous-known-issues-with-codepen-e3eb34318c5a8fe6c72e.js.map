Because the extension automatically uses HTTPS, it can cause a \\\"mixed content\\\" error that prevents the JSON/XML data from being loaded.

You can turn this off and enable a \\\"Run Button\\\", by going to Settings > Behaviour > \\\"Want a Run Button?\\\" and unticking the box.</li>\\n<li><strong>location.reload:</strong> If you run into an issue of your code working in the debug view or in JSFiddle, but not in Codepen editor view or full page view, double check if you used <code>location.reload()</code>. If you did, you have to find another way to achieve desired, because Codepen will strip <code>location.reload</code> and leave only <code>()</code> in your code.
