Many of the pros and cons are related to being a client-side language.</p>\n<h2>Advantages of JavaScript</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong>. Being client-side, JavaScript is very fast because any code functions can be run immediately instead of having to contact the server and wait for an answer.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>. JavaScript is relatively simple to learn and implement.</li>\n<li><strong>Versatility</strong>. JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and can be used in a huge variety of applications. Unlike PHP or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes\">SSI</a> scripts, JavaScript can be inserted into any web page regardless of the file extension. JavaScript can also be used inside scripts written in other languages such as Perl and PHP.</li>\n<li><strong>Server Load</strong>. Being client-side reduces the demand on the website server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Disadvantages of JavaScript</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security</strong>. Because the code executes on the users' computer, in some cases it can be exploited for malicious purposes. This is one reason some people choose to disable JavaScript.</li>\n<li><strong>Reliance on End User</strong>. JavaScript is sometimes interpreted differently by different browsers. Whereas server-side scripts will always produce the same output, client-side scripts can be a little unpredictable. Don't be overly concerned by this though - as long as you test your script in all the major browsers you should be safe.</li>\n</ul>",frontmatter:{title:"Advantages and Disadvantages of JavaScript",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/javascript/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-javascript/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/javascript/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-javascript/"}}}});
