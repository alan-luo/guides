Based on your OS (Windows or Linux or OSX), you might want to install Python 3 following <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<p>It is always a great idea to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandbox</a> your Python installation; and keeping it separate from your <em>System Python</em>. The <em>System Python</em> is the path to Python interpreter, which is used by other modules installed along with your OS.</p>\n<p>It\'s <strong>not safe</strong> to install Python Web-frameworks or libraries directly using <em>System Python</em>. Instead, you can use <a href="https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Virtualenv</a> to create and spawn a separate Python process when you are developing Python applications.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Virtualenvwrapper module</a> makes it easy for you to manage and sandbox multiple Python sandboxed environments in one machine; without corrupting any modules or services written in Python and used by your machine.</p>\n<p>Of course, most cloud hosted development environment such as <a href="https://www.nitrous.io/">Nitrous</a> or <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a> also comes with these pre-installed and ready for you to get coding! You can quickly pick a box from your dashboard, and start coding after activating a Python 3 environment.</p>\n<p>In <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>, you need to select the Django box while creating a new development environment.</p>\n<p>A few shell command examples would follow. If you wish to copy-paste, do note that the <code>$</code> sign is a shorthand for the terminal prompt, it\'s not part of the command. My terminal prompt looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>alayek:~/workspace (master) $\n</code></pre>\n<p>And, an <code>ls</code> would look like</p>\n<pre><code>alayek:~/workspace (master) $ ls\n</code></pre>\n<p>But, while writing the same in this documentation, I would be writing it as</p>\n<pre><code>$ ls\n</code></pre>\n<p>Getting back to our discussion, you can create a Python 3 interpreter-included sandbox on Cloud9 by running on your cloud terminal:</p>\n<pre><code>$ mkvirtualenv py3 --python=/usr/bin/python3\n</code></pre>\n<p>You have to run it only once after creating a new box for your project. Once executed, this command would create a new sandboxed virtualenv ready for you to use, named <code>py3</code>.</p>\n<p>To view available virtual environments, you can use</p>\n<pre><code>$ workon\n</code></pre>\n<p>To activate <code>py3</code>, you can use the <code>workon</code> command with the name of the environment:</p>\n<pre><code>$ workon py3\n</code></pre>\n<p>All three terminal commands above would also work on local Linux machines or OSX machines. These are <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#introduction">virtualenvwrapper</a> commands; so if you are planning on using them, make sure you have this module installed and added to <code>PATH</code> variable.</p>\n<p>If you are inside a virtual environment; you can easily find that out by checking your terminal prompt. The environment name would be clearly shown in your terminal prompt.</p>\n<p>For instance, when I am inside the <code>py3</code> environment; I would be seeing this as my terminal prompt:</p>\n<pre><code>(py3)alayek:~/workspace (master) $\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice the <code>(py3)</code> in braces! If for some reason, you are not seeing this, even if you are inside a virtual env; you can try doing one of the things <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1871549/python-determine-if-running-inside-virtualenv">mentioned here</a>.</p>\n<p>To get out of a virtual environment; or to deactivate one - use the command</p>\n<pre><code>$ deactivate\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, this works only with virtualenvwrapper module.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Installing and Using Python 3",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/python/installing-and-using-python-3/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/python/installing-and-using-python-3/"}}}});
