This can be accomplished with SocketIO, but that's not all SocketIO can do. Remember earlier, I mentioned that when using <em>$http.post</em> you had to update your local array with the database's version of the item you were posting? SocketIO keeps a user's browser environment synced with your database in realtime. This has two practical upshots:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You no longer have to manually update your local data with database data; it is all managed automatically</li>\n<li>You can push database changes live to users on different machines all at the same time</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even better, if you just include SocketIO when prompted during the yeoman angular-fullstack setup, there is absolutely no work involved to include it. It works out of the box, has a working demo on the <strong>main/</strong> route, and you can learn how to use it yourself by simply looking at how they include it in <strong>main.controller.js</strong> (so I won't go any further into detail).</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Angular Socketio",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/angular-socketio/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/angular-socketio/"}}}});
