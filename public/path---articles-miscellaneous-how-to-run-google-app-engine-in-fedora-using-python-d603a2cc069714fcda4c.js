Error 400: --- begin server output --- A version or backend parameter is required. --- end server output ---</code> </p>\n<p>This error occurs because of the missing Version statement in file <strong>app.yaml</strong>. So add <code>version: 1</code> in the <strong>app.yaml</strong> file in the application repository. Here, <code>helloworld</code> is the repository. Now it will work. Happy Coding &#x26; Making Application.</p>\n<p>Don\'t forget to check this link out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfgO-LXGpTM">Developing and deploying an application on Google App Engine on Youtube.</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"How To Run Google App Engine In Fedora Using Python",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/how-to-run-google-app-engine-in-fedora-using-python/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/how-to-run-google-app-engine-in-fedora-using-python/"}}}});
