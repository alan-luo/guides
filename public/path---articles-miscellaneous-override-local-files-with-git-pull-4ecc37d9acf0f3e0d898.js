With or without <code>--hard</code> option, any local commits that haven't been pushed will be lost.<br>\nIf you have any files that are not tracked by Git (e.g. uploaded user content), these files will not be affected.</p>\n<h2>The Overwrite workflow:</h2>\n<p>To overwrite your local files do:</p>\n<pre><code>git fetch --all\ngit reset --hard &#x3C;remote>/&#x3C;branch_name>\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>git fetch --all\ngit reset --hard origin/master\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How it works:</h2>\n<p><code>git fetch</code> downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.</p>\n<p>Then the git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The <code>--hard</code> option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in <code>origin/master</code>.</p>\n<h2>Additional Information:</h2>\n<p>It's worth noting that it is possible to maintain current local commits by creating a branch from <code>master</code> or whichever branch you want to work on before resetting:</p>\n<p>For Example:</p>\n<pre><code>git checkout master\ngit branch new-branch-to-save-current-commits\ngit fetch --all\ngit reset --hard origin/master\n</code></pre>\n<p>After this, all of the old commits will be kept in <code>new-branch-to-save-current-commits</code>. Uncommitted changes however (even staged), will be lost. Make sure to stash and commit anything you need.</p>\n<h2>Attribution:</h2>\n<p><em>This article is based on a Stack Overflow question <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125968/force-git-to-overwrite-local-files-on-pull/8888015#8888015\">here</a></em></p>",frontmatter:{title:"Override Local Files with Git Pull",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/override-local-files-with-git-pull/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/override-local-files-with-git-pull/"}}}});
