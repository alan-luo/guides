A component manages a portion of the page using the template within it.</p>\\n<p>Our component demonstrates the basic structure of any component you will ever write. It contains:  </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>import statements</strong> to pull in other components we will need  </li>\\n<li><strong>component decorator</strong> which lets angular know which template to use and how the component will be created. Basically, any meta data related to the component.  </li>\\n<li><strong>component class</strong> which controls the component's appearance and behavior</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Let's take a closer look at each line in our component.</p>\\n<h2>Import</h2>\\n<pre><code>import { Component } from '@angular/core';\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Since angular applications are modular, we can import any other modules or libraries we may need. Here, we are importing the Angular 2 core module to give our component access to the <code>@Component</code> decorator. Every app will need this import to get started.</p>\\n<p>Since we imported the <code>Component</code> function above, we can now use it to associate metadata with our component class that will tell Angular how our component should be created and the actions it will provide.</p>\\n<h2>Component decorator</h2>\\n<pre><code>    @Component({\\n      selector: 'my-app',\\n      template: '&#x3C;h1>Free Code Camp Rocks!&#x3C;/h1>'\\n    })\\n```    \\nOur metadata object has selector and template fields.\\n* The `selector` specifies a CSS selector that indicates which HTML element will represent this component. The element we will use will be named \\\"`my-app`\\\". Angular will use this to create an instance of our component where it finds this element.\\n* The `template` tells angular what template it will use for this component. This can refer to other Components or just a form of HTML that tells how to display the view for our component. Our template is just displaying an `h1` element containing the text \\\"`Free Code Camp Rocks!`\\\".\\n\\n## Component Class\\nOur final line provides an empty class named ***AppComponent***\\n```js\\nexport class AppComponent { }\\n```\\nIf we want to build a more complex component we can add logic and properties to the class. This component is extremely basic and simply displays some html, so its class will remain empty.\\n\\nWe export our class so we can use it in other components in our application.\\n\\nNext, we need to connect our root component to Angular. To do this we create another file in our app folder called *`main.ts`* that will have the following code:\\n```js\\n    import { bootstrap }    from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\\n    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';\\n    bootstrap(AppComponent);\\n```\\nThis file imports the two items we need to start our app.\\n* **`bootstrap`** - Angular's built in method that connects to the browser \\n* **`AppComponent`** - Our component we created above (which is why we exported it)\\nWe then call `bootstrap` method with `AppComponent`\\n\\n**Finally, create index.html**\\n\\n```html\\n    &#x3C;html>\\n      &#x3C;head>\\n        &#x3C;title>Free Code Camp - Angular 2 Tutorial&#x3C;/title>\\n        &#x3C;meta charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\">\\n        &#x3C;meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\\\">\\n        &#x3C;link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href=\\\"styles.css\\\">\\n        &#x3C;!-- 1\\\\.

It also imports `system.src.js` which is used as module loader to import the app.\\n\\nIn section 2, SystemJS is used to load our application and our various modules. In a production example we may want to use something else such as webpack. It was chosen here since we can use it with plunker.\\n\\nThis is all that is required to get our simple application running. &#x3C;a href=\\\"http://plnkr.co/edit/2i7Wjwd2JGj4NZtKvGD2\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Here is a link to a plunker&#x3C;/a> that contains our working application.

We will create a counter that let's you increment it by clicking a button.\\n\\nOur increment component will be its own module so that we can reuse it in later applications. \\n\\nLet's name our file: `app/increment-clicker.component.ts` and set it up.\\n```js\\n// app/increment-clicker.component.ts\\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core'; \\n\\n@Component({\\n    selector: 'increment-clicker',\\n    template: `\\n      &#x3C;div className=\\\"counter\\\">\\n        &#x3C;h1>{{curClicks}} clicks&#x3C;/h1>\\n        &#x3C;button type=\\\"button\\\" (click)=\\\"incrementClicks()\\\">Increment&#x3C;/button>\\n      &#x3C;/div>\\n    `,\\n    styles: [`\\n        .counter {\\n          width: 100%;\\n          margin: auto;\\n          background: darkgreen;\\n          border-radius: 5px;\\n          color: white;\\n          padding: 20px;\\n          text-align: center;\\n        }\\n        .counter h1 {\\n          margin: 0;\\n          padding: 20px;\\n          font-size: 36px;\\n        }\\n        .counter button {\\n          background: #f1c40f;\\n          border: 0;\\n          box-shadow: 0px 5px 0px #927608;\\n          padding: 20px;\\n          width: 100%;\\n          outline: none;\\n          border-radius: 5px;\\n          color: darkgreen;\\n          font-weight: bold;\\n        }\\n\\n        .counter button:hover {\\n          background: #a9890a;\\n          cursor: pointer;\\n        }\\n    `]\\n})\\n\\nexport class IncrementClicker {\\n  curClicks = 0;\\n\\n  incrementClicks() {\\n    this.curClicks++;\\n  }  \\n}\\n```\\nOur component structure is similar to our previous one, but we've added a bit of functionality here. You will notice our class is no longer empty. We've added a variable to track the clicks as well as a function to increment them when the user clicks the button.\\n\\nYou can display properties from your class in your template using double braces such as: `{{ variableName }}`\\n\\nWe bind the button click event to our class function using Angulars Event Bindings.\\n```html\\n&#x3C;button type=\\\"button\\\" (click)=\\\"incrementClicks()\\\">Increment&#x3C;/button>\\n```\\n\\nNotice that we've also added some styling to our components. This way everything is self-contained in this module. You may also include a `templateUrl` and/or `styleUrls` properties instead to extract the template and style rules to an external file and link them here.\\n\\nNow we just need to update our `AppComponent` to include our new component:\\n```js\\n// app/app.component.ts\\n\\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\\n\\n/* Nested Component */\\nimport { IncrementClicker } from 'app/increment-clicker.component';\\n\\n@Component({\\n  selector: 'my-app',\\n  directives: [IncrementClicker],\\n  template: `\\n    &#x3C;h1>Free Code Camp Rocks!&#x3C;/h1>\\n    &#x3C;increment-clicker>&#x3C;/increment-clicker>\\n  `,\\n  styles: [`\\n    h1 { color: darkgreen; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}\\n  `]  \\n})\\n\\nexport class AppComponent { }\\n```\\nTo pull in our new `IncrementClicker` component we need to import it by including the class name as well as the location of the typescript file as we did on this line:\\n```js\\nimport { IncrementClicker } from 'app/increment-clicker.component';\\n```\\nWe then add the `IncrementClicker` *component* as a directive to the `AppComponent` module using:\\n```js\\ndirectives: [IncrementClicker],\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Finally, we just add the tag that our component connects to in the template.

So the selector in our <code>IncrementClicker</code> component will match the tag where we want it to show up.<br>\\n<code>js template:</code> <h1>Free Code Camp Rocks!</h1> <increment-clicker></increment-clicker> <code>,</code><br>\\nOur component is now included in our app!<br>\\n<a href=\\\"http://plnkr.co/edit/BdvNONEmO3Jwg0EavX22\\\">Updated Code</a><br>\\n<a href=\\\"http://run.plnkr.co/plunks/BdvNONEmO3Jwg0EavX22/\\\">VIEW COMPLETE APPLICATION</a></p>\",\n\t\t\t\"frontmatter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Angular 2 Starter Project\",\n\t\t\t\t\"parent\": \"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/angular-2-starter-project/index.md absPath of file\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\t\"pathContext\": {\n\t\t\"slug\": \"/articles/miscellaneous/angular-2-starter-project/\"\n\t}\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/articles-miscellaneous-angular-2-starter-project.json\n// module id = ./node_modules/json-loader/index.js!./.cache/json/articles-miscellaneous-angular-2-starter-project.json\n// module chunks = 445"],"sourceRoot":""}
