Expanding upon the "card" motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.</p>\n<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw">video</a> gives you an idea about material design:</p>\n<h2>Check out this websites that are using Materialize, See the difference to what you\'re used to!</h2>\n<p>Test them on your phone too for a better feel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://www.100xp.io/">The 100</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="http://demo.geekslabs.com/materialize/v2.1/">Admin Themes</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="http://www.straphq.com/">StrapHq</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More examples <a href="http://materializecss.com/showcase.html">here</a></p>\n<h2>A bootstrap alternative, really?</h2>\n<p>Chill, nothing can ever beat bootstrap, imo. However, materialize CSS offers just that, Materializ-ation - The feeling of interacting with the interface as if its a physical material, like paper. I just came up with that.</p>\n<p>But really...</p>\n<p>I do like materialize because of its simplicity, for example;</p>\n<p>In bootstrap you would do this to a button</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">\nMy Button\n&#x3C;/button>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Basically each class name repeatedly has the btn- attached to it. And this is mostly the case for many other bootstrap components especially when you want to add simple classes like color.</p>\n<p>With Materialize you can add all the classes simply like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;button class="btn waves-effect waves-light green">My Button&#x3C;/a>\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, use of the btn- has been reduced. The <code>green</code> class can be re-used with any/all other HTML element other than the <code>button</code> shown in this case.</p>\n<p>There is another lighter version of material Design Framework but its not as elegant or simple as the materializeCSS framework Other than this simplicity, here are more reasons why I love materializeCSS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It\'s simple! -- Just emphasizing</li>\n<li>It\'s open-source, you can git it here</li>\n<li>A community is also growing around it</li>\n<li><a href="http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/">Someone</a> is looking to produce a blend of Bootstrap + Materialize. Sweeet!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Anything else?</h2>\n<p>Try it out and maybe you will love it. In fact since thats where even android UI is already headed, this might a good way to get yourself better at Material design for mobile-focused web-apps like <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/your-first-progressive-web-app/#what-will-you-learn">progressive web apps</a></p>\n<h3>Maybe you shouldn\'t use it ...yet</h3>\n<p>It\'s undergoing changes being at alpha stage. So you might skip it and not use it on crucial project until it matures.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Materializecss Framework As A An Alternative To Bootstrap",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/materializecss-framework-as-a-an-alternative-to-bootstrap/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/materializecss-framework-as-a-an-alternative-to-bootstrap/"}}}});
