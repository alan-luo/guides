You might as well be aware as to what a web framework is; and the options available for Python.</p>\n<p>In case these assumptions are untrue, you might want to take a look at this <a>wiki article</a>. If you are all caught up, let\'s go ahread with setting up Python web frameworks in your local development machine.</p>\n<p>But it would be unfair if we completely ignore the <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/which-python/#the-state-of-python-2-vs-3">Python 2 vs Python 3</a> debate.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>We have successfully installed the web-framework of our need. However, it\'s not yet complete. Most web applications are content and data driven - so we need a data storage. Or, a Database, if you will.</p>\n<p>In next article, we would be discussing how to install PostgreSQL and use it with our Python web application.</p>\n<p>A point to ponder - we have been using <code>pip</code> heavily, but we have barely said anything about it. Well, for now, it\'s just a package manager like <code>npm</code>. It has some differences with <code>npm</code>; but, you don\'t need to worry about that now. If you are interested, do check out the <a href="http://pip-python3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">official <code>pip</code> documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><em>If you have suggestions or questions, come join us on <a href="https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp">gitter</a></em>.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Setting up Python Web Framework Django and Flask",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/python/setting-up-python-web-framework-django-and-flask/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/python/setting-up-python-web-framework-django-and-flask/"}}}});
