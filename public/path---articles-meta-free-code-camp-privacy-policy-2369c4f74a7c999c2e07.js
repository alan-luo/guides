For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.</p>\n<h2>Anonymous Information</h2>\n<p>Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other organizations we associate with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to an organization that a certain percentage of our site\'s visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.</p>\n<h2>Cookies and Beacons--Use by Free Code Camp; Opting Out</h2>\n<p>We use cookies and software logs to monitor the use of FreeCodeCamp.com and to gather non-personal information about visitors to the site. Cookies are small files that Free Code Camp transfers to the hard drives of visitors for record-keeping purposes. These monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance, Comcast) they use. This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services requested by our customers.

We use third party beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one Free Code Camp.com page to another and to improve site performance. None of the information we gather in this way can be used to identify any individual who visits our site.</p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>Any personally identifiable information collected through this site is stored on limited-access servers.
