You'll also learn soon that you can define your app's <a>/url/heirarchy/fairly/arbitrarily</a>. You won't really need to edit <strong>main.js</strong> or <strong>main.controller.spec.js</strong>, so let's not worry about those right now. If you look through the <strong>main.html</strong> file you'll see it uses <em>ng-repeat</em> to show <em>things</em> in <em>awesomeThings</em>. Where does it get <em>awesomeThings</em>?</li>\n<li><strong>main/main.controller.js</strong>: all of the javascript functions you want to use to interact directly with the user go here! You'll put functions here to interact with your API, refresh views for your user, etc. Here, <em>awesomeThings</em> are pulled from your database and added to the local scope so your HTML view can display them! How cool! We'll get to adding custom objects to your database in a minute.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Great! Now you know how to interact with the user! But what if you want your app to have another page that does something else? Maybe <strong>main.html</strong> shows the home page, but you want a page that shows a form to add a poll? maybe <a><a href=\"http://yourapp.wherever.itis/newpage\">http://yourapp.wherever.itis/newpage</a></a>? This is where the yeoman generator comes in handy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/guides-to-back-end-projects/14265\">PREVIOUS</a> <a>NEXT</a></p>",frontmatter:{title:"Front End File Structure",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/front-end-file-structure/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/front-end-file-structure/"}}}});
