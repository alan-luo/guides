The key, which is used to identify the data, is given as an input to the hashing function.

But in this case, the wasted space isn’t so bad either. Taking the length of a string is nice and fast, and so is the process of finding the value associated with a given key (certainly faster than doing up to five string comparisons).</p>\\n<p>But, what do we do if our dataset has a string which has more than 11 characters?<br>\\nWhat if we have one another word with 5 characters, \\\"India\\\", and try assigning it to an index using our hash function. Since the index 5 is already occupied, we have to make a call on what to do with it. This is called a collision.</p>\\n<p>If our dataset had a string with thousand characters, and you make an array of thousand indices to store the data, it would result in a wastage of space.

In our example, when we add India to the dataset, it is appended to the linked list stored at the index 5, then our table would look like this.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Position</th>\\n<th>Linked List Heads</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>1</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>2</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>3</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>4</td>\\n<td>[\\nCuba-Havana\\n]</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>5</td>\\n<td>[\\nSpain-Madrid\\n]\\n -> \\n[\\nIndia-Delhi\\n]</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>6</td>\\n<td>[\\nFrance-Paris\\n]</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>7</td>\\n<td>[\\nEngland-London\\n]</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>8</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>9</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>10</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>11</td>\\n<td>[\\nSwitzerland-Bern\\n]</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>To find an item we first go to the bucket and then compare keys. This is a popular method, and if a list of links is used the hash never fills up. The cost for <code>get(k)</code> is on average <code>O(n)</code> where n is the number of keys in the bucket, total number of keys be N.<br>\\nThe problem with separate chaining is that the data structure can grow with out bounds.</p>\\n<h4>Open Addressing</h4>\\n<p>Open addressing does not introduce any new data structure. If a collision occurs then we look for availability in the next spot generated by an algorithm. Open Addressing is generally used where storage space is a restricted, i.e. embedded processors.
