Python itself comes with several built-in modules, but the python community has more to offer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Its the modules that makes python so powerful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Third party modules add so much more functionality to Python. Now we would learn how to install these modules so that we can use those in our programs.</p>\n<p>The simplest way is to use <code>pip</code></p>\n<pre><code>pip install &#x3C;module_name>\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you have used <code>npm</code>, then you can think of it as <em>npm</em> of python.</p>\n<p>Last time, in <a><code>import-statements</code></a> wiki we used <code>requests</code> module as an example. As it is a third party module we have to install it separately after installing python.</p>\n<p>Installing it would be as simple as <code>pip install requests</code> . You can even pass various arguments along with it. The one that you\'ll come across more often is <code>--upgrade</code>. You can upgrade a python module by :</p>\n<pre><code>pip install &#x3C;module_name> --upgrade\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, to upgrade the requests module to its latest version would be as simple as <code>pip install requests --upgrade</code>.</p>\n<p>Before using <code>pip</code>, you will need to install it (it\'s quite simple). You can install it from <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py">here</a></p>\n<p>Just click on the link. And save the file as<code>get-pip.py</code> <em>Please don\'t forget the <code>.py</code> extension.</em> And run it.</p>\n<p>An alternative to using pip would be to try <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py"><code>easy_install</code></a>.</p>\n<p>Using <code>easy_install</code> is also simple. The syntax is:</p>\n<pre><code>easy_install &#x3C;module_name>\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, <code>pip</code> is more popular than using <code>easy_install</code>.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Python Using Pip",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/python/python-using-pip/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/python/python-using-pip/"}}}});
