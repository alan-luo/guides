Whether or not the object's value(s) can change after creation determines if the object is mutable (can change) or immutable (can't change).</p>\n<p>So far we have learned about a few types of objects and their subclasses: <code>string</code>s and numeric (integer, floating point, complex, and boolean) objects. All of these are <strong>immutable</strong> objects.</p>\n<p>This concept might be confusing at first because what good is an object if you can't modify it. What makes these objects usable is the ability to assign and reassign variables. Functions and operators can return new objects that can be assigned to variables.</p>\n<p>Using the built-in <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id\">id function</a>, which returns the identity of an object, we can see how this works.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assigning a variable does not mean that <em>variable</em> is the <em>object</em>. We used very specific language noting that <em>assignment statements</em> <strong>bind</strong> a <strong>name</strong> (identifier) to an <em>object</em>.
