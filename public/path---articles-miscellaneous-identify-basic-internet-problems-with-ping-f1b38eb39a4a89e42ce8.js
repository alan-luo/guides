Using a command called "ping", built right into your existing Mac, Windows, or Linux computer, will help identify basic connection problems. Okay, this might not be enough to "wow" your fellow team members, however they will appreciate that you started the debug process. And please remember that your Support personnel are debug specialists, so follow their instructions when they step you through the troubleshooting sequence.</p>\n<h2>TL;DR:</h2>\n<p>You can use the <code>ping</code> command built into your Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux computer to identify basic network connectivity issues. This can help you solve the problem and/or gain valuable debug information as a first step before calling support. Read below for details on how to launch a command line window and run <code>ping</code> from your Mac OS X or Windows machine.</p>\n<h2>The <code>ping</code> command:</h2>\n<p>The <code>ping</code> command is a simple way to verify that another computer can receive information from you. The original author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Muuss">Mike Muuss</a>, actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)#History">named the program after the "ping" sound</a> that a submarine sends to detect objects in the water. If an echo of the ping comes back, it means that there is something out there. In fact, <code>ping</code> uses the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">Internet Control Message Protocol Echo Request</a>" as part of its underlying software design.</p>\n<p>In its simplest form, the <code>ping</code> command provides two valuable pieces of information, whether the message was echoed back (<code>64 bytes from…</code>) and how long it takes to receive the message back (e.g., <code>time=6.396 ms</code>). Depending on what type of computer you are using, you may even get a summary containing minimum, maximum, average, and more. The response time is shown in "ms", or millisecond, which is 1/1000th of a second. A response time of 10ms or less is pretty fast, however values are often in the 100ms range. At much above 200ms you\'ll probably notice that you have a sluggish connection.</p>\n<h2>When all is well:</h2>\n<p>This is what my <code>ping</code> response looks like on my Mac OS X computer when everything is working normally here in Malaysia:</p>\n<pre><code>MacBook-Pro:~ ajm$ ping Google.com\nPING google.com (216.58.196.46): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 216.58.196.46: icmp\\_seq=0 ttl=55 time=6.396 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.196.46: icmp\\_seq=1 ttl=55 time=6.368 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.196.46: icmp\\_seq=2 ttl=55 time=26.773 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.196.46: icmp\\_seq=3 ttl=55 time=6.984 ms\n^C\n--- google.com ping statistics ---\n4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 6.368/11.630/26.773/8.746 ms\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is what my <code>ping</code> response looks like on a Windows computer when everything is working well:</p>\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\BJM>ping Google.com\nPinging google.com [216.58.196.46] with 32 bytes of data:\nReply from 216.58.196.46: bytes=32 time=6ms TTL=128\nReply from 216.58.196.46: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=128\nReply from 216.58.196.46: bytes=32 time=6ms TTL=128\nReply from 216.58.196.46: bytes=32 time=6ms TTL=128\nPing statistics for 216.58.196.46:\n    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\nApproximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\n    Minimum = 6ms, Maximum = 15ms, Average = 8ms\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see from these examples that the connection is pretty good with average response times under 10ms.</p>\n<h3>When something is wrong (three examples):</h3>\n<p>So what would happen if I could not connect to <code>Google.com</code>? For example <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, I simulate a broken network connection to my Mac by unplugging my router from the wall, and re-run the command. The first thing I notice is that it takes a <em>lot</em> longer for the command to respond:</p>\n<pre><code>MacBook-Pro:~ ajm$ ping google.com\nping: cannot resolve google.com: Unknown host\nMacBook-Pro:~ ajm$\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, for example <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, depending on exactly how the connection is failing:</p>\n<pre><code>PING google.com (216.58.196.46): 56 data bytes\nRequest timeout for icmp\\_seq 0\nRequest timeout for icmp\\_seq 1\nRequest timeout for icmp\\_seq 2\n^C\n</code></pre>\n<p>And sometimes, if I have a particularly flaky connection, I\'ll see a mixture of these messages. For example <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, I can simulate this by connecting my Mac computer to a public Wi-Fi connection that is across the street:</p>\n<pre><code>PING google.com (216.58.196.206): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 216.58.196.206: icmp\\_seq=0 ttl=57 time=273.655 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.196.206: icmp\\_seq=1 ttl=57 time=808.546 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.196.206: icmp\\_seq=2 ttl=57 time=179.613 ms\nRequest timeout for icmp\\_seq 3\nRequest timeout for icmp\\_seq 4\n64 bytes from 216.58.196.206: icmp\\_seq=5 ttl=57 time=374.612 ms\nRequest timeout for icmp\\_seq 6\nping: sendto: No route to host\nRequest timeout for icmp\\_seq 7\nping: sendto: No route to host\nRequest timeout for icmp\\_seq 8\n^C\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the first test, <code>ping</code> told me that my machine could not even find the Internet address (IP <code>216.58.196.46</code>) for <code>Google.com</code>. In the second test, my computer remembered Google\'s IP address, but could not actually reach the Google servers (<code>Request timeout</code>). In the third test, <code>sendto: No route to host</code> means that the network device knows where the Google servers are, but something along the digital pathway is broken.</p>\n<h2>Mac Users: How to run the <code>ping</code> command:</h2>\n<p>On a Mac, you typically run <code>ping</code> from the terminal command line. To start the terminal, click the OS X Spotlight magnifying glass icon in the upper right of the desktop:</p>\n<p><img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/9/924e9346b5f92fe41127f6b3e403f454773edae9.png" alt="Mac Spotlight"></p>\n<p>When the search window appears, type "terminal", highlight "Terminal – Utilities", and double-click (or hit</p>\n<p><kbd>return</kbd></p>\n<p>): <img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/9/976e1fb628c0d0bf2a6a9b57504305fd844716d4.png" alt="Mac Terminal Launch"></p>\n<p>That will launch the terminal command window, and you can enter the command <code>ping Google.com</code> shown in my examples: <img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/05d1e4d360c14921f7bd7ab871358b956f1e7d03.png" alt="Mac Command Line"></p>\n<p><strong>Important Mac Tip</strong> : The <code>ping</code> command will run forever if you don\'t tell it to stop. To do that, press the</p>\n<p><code>control</code></p>\n<p>key (lower right on keyboard) and the</p>\n<p><code>c</code></p>\n<p>key. That will interrupt the test with a Control-C (<code>^C</code>) and give back command line control. For Windows user, the command will stop by itself after a few iterations.</p>\n<h2>Windows Users: How to run the <code>ping</code> command:</h2>\n<p>Opening the Command Prompt differs between Windows versions 10, 8.1, 8, and 7; here\'s a great guide at <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/commandlinereference/f/open-command-prompt.htm">How To Open Command Prompt</a>. On a Windows 7 machine, for example, click on the lower left Windows "Start" icon, and select "Command Prompt" and double-click (or hit</p>\n<p><code>enter</code></p>\n<p>):</p>\n<p><img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/4e0b18755930ad0d64e6e38763f0b96054fd76fb.png" alt="Win Terminal Launch"></p>\n<p>This will launch the command window, and you can enter the command <code>ping Google.com</code> shown in the examples:</p>\n<p><img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/9/94d8ed91d29574497ad0f2eb2cd235050132851e.png" alt="Win Command Line"></p>\n<p>Now that you know how to use the <code>ping</code> command, you can do basic troubleshooting of your network connection. With a little bit of creativity, you can work with your local IT support person or knowledge of your network topology and IP address (e.g., <code>ping</code> the router, <code>ping</code> your ISP) to further identify network issues.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Identify Basic Internet Problems with Ping",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/identify-basic-internet-problems-with-ping/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/identify-basic-internet-problems-with-ping/"}}}});
