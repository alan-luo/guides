You can get it <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">here</a>), then you may have already noticed some of the tab completion capabilities. For example, when you are opening an html tag such as <code>&#x3C;p></code>, it automatically closes the tag as soon as you type <code>/</code>. You can get similar functionality for pieces of code you end up re-writing over and over, and it\'s surprisingly easy!</p>\n<p>Here\'s an example, which activates after typing <code>div</code> and then tab:</p>\n<p><img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/5/59a4d233d2dcb17b76a9c36ca30c5bb07a35d00b.png" alt="alt text"></p>\n<h2>Step 1.</h2>\n<p>Click <code>Tools > New Snippet...</code> in the navigation bar. This will open a snippet skeletton file which will look like this:</p>\n<p><img src="//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/a56106fbf754f7e641342d1ebdbc3f5bed582263.png" alt="alt text"></p>\n<h2>Step 2.</h2>\n<p>You will add the snippet by replacing the text <code>Hello, ${1:this} is a ${2:snippet}.</code></p>\n<p>In the case of the <code>div</code> snippet, it\'s as simple as placing the following text in the snippet area:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- $1 -->\n&#x3C;div class= "$1">\n\n&#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;!-- $1 -->\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>$</code> operator references the variables that will be typed in once you type <code>div</code> and then tab. In fact you can have any number of them!</p>\n<h2>Step 3.</h2>\n<p>Save the file. You can give it any filename you want, but the extension <strong>must</strong> be <code>.sublime-snippet</code>. Remember, you can only have one snippet per file! I like to give them descriptive names such as <code>html-div.sublime-snippet</code>.</p>\n<p>And there you have it! You can get as creative as you want.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Adding Snippets To Your Sublime Text Installation",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/adding-snippets-to-your-sublime-text-installation/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/adding-snippets-to-your-sublime-text-installation/"}}}});
