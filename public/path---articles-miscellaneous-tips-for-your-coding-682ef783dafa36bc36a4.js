Plan out the logic you\'re trying to implement in your native language before you try to put it into code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Comment your code! Can\'t stress that one enough, if you get lost or take a break then come back you need to know what your code is trying to do. It will also reinforce what the code means to you, and help other people understand what your code does if you get stuck and ask for help. If you\'ve got a any other tips for campers I\'d love to see them!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use the chrome javascript debugger console in conjunction with something like the netbeans IDE or sublime text to write your code.
