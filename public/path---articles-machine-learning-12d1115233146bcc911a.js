Consider the example of a Machine Learning algorithm that plays chess. In this example, <code>E</code> refers to the experience of playing chess, <code>T</code> is the task of playing chess, and <code>P</code> denotes the probability that the program will win the next game of chess.</p>\n<p>In general, machine learning problems can be classified into supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, you already have the input and the correct output, and know that a relationship exists between the input and the output. When you know neither what the correct output is nor if a relationship exists, unsupervised learning will help you derive structure if there is one.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning on Wikipedia</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:</p>\n<p>1.Supervised learning.\n2.Unsupervised learning.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Machine Learning",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/machine-learning/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/machine-learning/"}}}});
