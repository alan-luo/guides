If you have some code that you want to share with the world, publishing a module to NPM is easy.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Create your script</h2>\n<p>I created this simple utility as <code>index.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>var time = new Date().toTimeString();\nconsole.log(time);\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 2: Create package information</h2>\n<p>The next step is to create the information to publish with your package, stored in <code>package.json</code>. NPM provides a wizard to make creating this file easy.</p>\n<p>Simply run <code>npm init</code> and answer the questions.</p>\n<p>Your <code>package.json</code> should look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  "name": "whattimeisit",\n  "version": "1.0.0",\n  "description": "accurate time retrieval",\n  "main": "index.js",\n  "author": "HoursAndMinutes",\n  "license": "ISC"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don\'t forget to include the GitHub repository link if the code is on GitHub!</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Create a user account on NPM</h2>\n<p>In order to publish a package to NPM, you need to have an account registered. To do that, run <code>npm adduser</code>. You can verify the account currently in use with <code>npm config ls</code>.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Publish to NPM</h2>\n<p>Before you publish your package to NPM, check if the directory contains any files you do not want made public (e.g. passwords, private keys etc). You can add these to a file named <code>.npmignore</code> to exclude them from package publishing. NPM will also honor <code>.gitignore</code> if you have that.</p>\n<p>Once you have finalized your package contents, run <code>npm publish</code>. You can confirm the details of your package at <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/yourpackagename">https://npmjs.com/package/yourpackagename</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Create An Npm Module",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/create-an-npm-module/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/create-an-npm-module/"}}}});
