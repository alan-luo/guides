We can derive structure from data where we don\'t necessarily know the effect of the variables.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Clustering: Is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Unsupervised Learning",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/machine-learning/unsupervised-learning/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/machine-learning/unsupervised-learning/"}}}});
