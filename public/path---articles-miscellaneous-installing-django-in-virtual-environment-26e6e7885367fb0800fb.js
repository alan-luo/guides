For instance, the file structure when you create a Django project. But, if you wish to explore the field of web development in Python in detail; perhaps <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> is more up your alley. Feel free to skip this part of the article, and jump directly to the <a href="#installing-flask-in-virtual-environment">Flask Installation help</a></p>\n<p>As of this writing, current Django version was Django 1.9.2. But when you are reading this, right now, it could be higher.</p>\n<p>The official installation guide is available <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/install/#install-django">here</a>. You should install the latest stable and official release; and <strong>not</strong> the latest development version (unless you know what you are doing and you like to live dangerously!)</p>\n<p>But before you start installing, make sure you are inside an <strong>activated</strong> virtual environment; where running the following command in terminal would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ python --version\nPython 3.5.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>It might not be <code>3.5.1</code> for you. It could very well be <code>3.4.3</code>. But that is ok, just as long as it does not show it as <code>2.7.9</code> or something else that starts with <code>2</code>.</p>\n<p>Once you have ensured you are in an activated virtual environment, and <code>python</code> command points to a Python of version 3; you are ready to install Django. Just follow the official <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/install/#installing-official-release">installation guide</a> and install it with <code>pip</code>, the Python package manager.</p>\n<p>Once installed; it would be a great idea to check what all did <code>pip</code> install; by executing the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ pip freeze\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would output a list of modules installed with current Python; and you should see Django with proper version (something like <code>Django==1.9.2</code> in the list.</p>\n<p>If you wish to use Windows, the above discussion is not applicable to you. Perhaps you only have access to a Windows machine, and for some personal reasons, you would prefer not working on a browser-based Linux box on the cloud (slow connection, perhaps?).</p>\n<p>You might be able to follow this <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/windows/">tutorial</a> and set up Django with Python 3 in your Windows machine.</p>\n<p>Or, you can use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> with a <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> box for Django development directly in your machine!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Installing Django In Virtual Environment",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/installing-django-in-virtual-environment/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/installing-django-in-virtual-environment/"}}}});
