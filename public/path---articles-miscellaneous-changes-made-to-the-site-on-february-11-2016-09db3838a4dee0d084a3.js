Free Code Camp should now be faster than ever.</li>\n<li>A huge thanks to <a href="https://gitter.im/berkeleytrue">@berkeleytrue</a> for leading this effort, and to the many campers who helped QA these improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Introducing our new Wiki</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Our wiki is now on FreeCodeCamp.com itself (as opposed to on our main project\'s GitHub Wiki).</li>\n<li>Our wiki pops out like our chat and map do. We welcome feedback on this new functionality. Hotkeys, context aware wiki articles, and other features will come soon.</li>\n<li>A big thanks to <a href="https://gitter.im/saintpeter">@saintpeter</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/hallaathrad">@hallaathrad</a>, and <a href="https://gitter.im/awesomeaniruddh">@awesomeaniruddh</a>, along with many other campers for their hard work on this!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Opening our Shop</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We have a new t-shirt campaign going on until February 15. Hurry up and buy one of these awesome Free Code Camp t-shirts: <a href="https://teespring.com/free-code-camp-feb">click here for our US campaign</a> | <a href="https://teespring.com/free-code-camp-t-shirt-eu-shop">click here for our EU campaign</a></li>\n<li>We created a new shop page. It only links to our t-shirt campaign now, but we will soon have laptop stickers and other cool gear.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Retiring Camper News</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Over the past year, Camper News has been a modest success. But so has our subreddit, which allows for commenting, moderation, and many other features. So we are shifting to Reddit for news sharing.</li>\n<li>We recommend creating a Reddit account if you don\'t already have one and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freecodecamp">joining our subreddit</a>. You can now share links with our entire community there, as well as your thoughts and questions.</li>\n<li>We will keep Camper News live for a while, but we\'re removing the link to it from our navigation menu, and removing the challenge that introduced it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Updating challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Many campers asked that we create an easier, HTML-focused project to precede "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage". So we\'ve created a new project that can be completed using only HTML and Bootstrap called "Build a Tribute Page".</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also resequenced our front end projects. Here\'s how they\'re now structured:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Basic Front End Projects</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a Tribute Page</li>\n<li>Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intermediate Front End Projects</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a Random Quote Machine</li>\n<li>Show the Local Weather</li>\n<li>Build a Wikipedia Viewer</li>\n<li>Use the Twitch.tv JSON API</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advanced Front End Projects</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a JavaScript Calculator</li>\n<li>Build a Pomodoro Clock</li>\n<li>Build a Tic Tac Toe Game</li>\n<li>Build a Simon Game</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You\'ll note that we\'ve removed the "Build a Camper News Viewer" project since we\'re retiring Camper News. If you\'ve previously completed that challenge, the "Build a Tribute Page" should already be marked completed for you on your map.</li>\n<li>Also, for "Build a Tic Tac Toe Game", you no longer need to make it unbeatable. (You certainly can if you want - <a href="http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax">here\'s how</a>. Although doing so is a useful exercise, writing an AI is a departure from the project\'s focus, which is front end development.</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added three new optional challenges that help you join our:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/freecodecamp">subreddit</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com">Medium publication</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://twitch.tv/freecodecamp">Twitch.tv channel</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Coming soon</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We will launch our Spanish challenges in the next few days.</li>\n<li>We plan to release optional React, Sass, and D3 challenges this Spring. But don\'t wait - you can complete the projects with the help of these projects\' official documentation - 16 campers have already done just that.</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{title:"Changes Made to the Site on February 11 2016",parent:"/home/stuart/guides/src/pages/articles/miscellaneous/changes-made-to-the-site-on-february-11-2016/index.md absPath of file"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/articles/miscellaneous/changes-made-to-the-site-on-february-11-2016/"}}}});
